[12.720 --> 14.720] The name of the story is
[16.040 --> 18.040] Clever Fish
[18.440 --> 25.000] One day a fisherman was fishing to a river as usual
[26.000 --> 33.420] He threw his net into the river and he just sat waiting there for fish to get him
[34.200 --> 36.200] so that he could
[36.560 --> 38.800] sell a lot of fish in the market and
[39.640 --> 41.640] Get some good money out of it
[43.000 --> 45.000] after some time
[45.120 --> 49.040] Fisherman heard some rustle and bustle in the net
[49.880 --> 55.240] Thinking that he must have got a lot of fish in the net
[55.680 --> 59.720] He actually took out the net out of water
[62.080 --> 69.480] But then to his dismay he saw just one tiny little fish in that net
[70.880 --> 72.880] He grabbed hold of that fish
[73.880 --> 76.240] But then suddenly the fish
[77.000 --> 79.000] started talking to him
[79.160 --> 81.160] The tiny little fish said to the fisherman
[82.360 --> 84.360] Oh fisherman, please
[84.360 --> 86.360] Please leave me
[86.360 --> 88.360] Please leave me
[88.360 --> 90.360] Otherwise I will die
[90.360 --> 92.360] I will die out of water
[93.520 --> 99.360] But fisherman did not give any attention to the request of the fish
[100.320 --> 102.160] but then
[102.160 --> 105.800] Again that tiny little fish said to the fisherman
[105.800 --> 111.720] Oh fisherman, I will tell you something which is of your help
[111.920 --> 114.200] If you leave me back in water
[114.200 --> 120.920] I will tell all my friends about you and I will bring them near to the bank of river
[121.160 --> 126.320] So that when you come next time you will have much more fish
[129.360 --> 131.360] Fisherman thought to himself
[131.360 --> 134.560] Wow, that's not a bad deal at all
[135.360 --> 139.400] He was thinking if I let go one tiny little fish today
[140.080 --> 142.960] Tomorrow I will get a lot of more fish
[143.480 --> 148.780] Because this tiny little fish will bring all his friends to me
[150.480 --> 152.880] Believing the word of this tiny little fish
[154.640 --> 158.960] Fisherman let go this tiny little fish into the river again
[159.360 --> 166.880] This tiny little fish was really happy and it swam away happily into the river
[167.600 --> 169.600] Never to come back
[169.600 --> 171.600] Poor fisherman
[171.600 --> 173.600] He came next day
[173.600 --> 179.440] Expecting that there will be a lot of fish that this tiny little fish would bring
[180.960 --> 185.200] But that tiny little fish was very clever and
[185.200 --> 187.200] Because of his cleverness
[187.280 --> 192.480] Because of his cleverness he saved his life from this fisherman
[193.120 --> 195.120] so children
[195.120 --> 197.120] Moral of the story is
[197.320 --> 200.080] You have to be really really clever
[200.600 --> 204.960] To save your life from such challenging moments
